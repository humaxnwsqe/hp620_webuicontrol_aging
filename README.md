Please execute 'testLaunher.py' using python command like below:
> python .\testLauncher.py

Before running 'testLauncher.py', please make a factory default setting through WEB UI or other ways.
And then check available serial port information and log in to the serial port using id/pw.
These python codes are working based on a 'COM7' serial port.
So if your environment is not using COM7, please change the serial port which your environment is available in the codes.
If you don't have information about the id/pw, please contact to any members who may know it.
Also please log in to WEB UI and then change a default log in password to '000000'
